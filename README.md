## Vagrantfiles

A collection of Vagrantfiles that I use generally. **Make sure that Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed**.

Some scripts requires the VM to be rebooted. Vagrant supports reboot with its plugin `vagrant-reload`. To install it, use the command:

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```
